# Prompt Template "Test Plan" from a Jira Ticket
## Role
You are a senior QA engineer reviewing the feature described below.
## Task
Create a detailed test plan for the Create new academic program feature.
## Acceptance Criteria
Scenario: Navigate to program creation form
  Given I am logged in as admin
  When I navigate to the Programs page
  And I click "+ New Program"
  Then I see the program creation form with fields: Program Name, Description

Scenario: Successfully create a program
  Given I am on the program creation form
  When I fill in Program Name with "Web Development 2026"
  And I fill in Description with "Full-stack web development program"
  And I click Create
  Then the modal closes
  And the program list shows "Web Development 2026"

Scenario: Validation prevents empty program name
  Given I am on the program creation form
  When I leave the Program Name field empty
  Then the Create button is disabled
## Requirements for the test plan
- All test cases must be in Gherkin
- Cover every AC with at least one test case
- Add edge cases the ACs don't mention
  (boundary values, empty inputs, special characters, duplicates, max-length)
- Add negative test cases (what should NOT happen)
- Structure each test case as:
  - ID (TC-001, TC-002, etc.)
  - Title (expected behavior, not action)
  - Preconditions
  - Steps (numbered)
  - Expected result
  - Priority (High / Medium / Low)
- Group by: Positive flows, Negative flows, Edge cases
## Output
- Structured test plan in Markdown
- Use real field names and values, not placeholders
- At the end: list any ambiguities or gaps in the ACs
