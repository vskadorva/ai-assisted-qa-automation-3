# Prompt Template "Test Plan" from a Jira Ticket
## Role
You are a senior QA engineer reviewing the feature described below.
## Task
Create a detailed test plan for the Program name validation and duplicate prevention feature.
## Acceptance Criteria
Scenario: Reject program name with only whitespace
  Given I am on the program creation form
  When I enter "   " as the program name
  And I click Create
  Then the form is not submitted (name is trimmed, treated as empty)
Scenario: Accept program name with special characters
  Given I am on the program creation form
  When I enter "Informatique & IA - Niveau 2" as the program name
  And I fill other required fields
  And I click Create
  Then the program is created successfully
Scenario: Reject duplicate program name
  Given a program "Web Development 2026" already exists
  When I try to create a new program with the same name
  Then I see an error indicating the name already exists
## Requirements for the test plan
- All test cases must be in Gherkin
- Cover every AC with at least one test case
- Add edge cases the ACs don't mention
  (boundary values, empty inputs, special characters, duplicates, max-length)
- Add negative test cases (what should NOT happen)
- Structure each test case as:
  - ID (TC-001, TC-002, etc.)
  - Title (expected behavior, not action)
  - Preconditions
  - Steps (numbered)
  - Expected result
  - Priority (High / Medium / Low)
- Group by: Positive flows, Negative flows, Edge cases
## Output
- Structured test plan in Markdown
- Use real field names and values, not placeholders
- At the end: list any ambiguities or gaps in the ACs
