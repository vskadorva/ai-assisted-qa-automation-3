# Prompt Template "Test Plan" from a Jira Ticket
## Role
You are a senior QA engineer reviewing the feature described below.
## Task
Create a detailed test plan for the Delete program with confirmation feature.
## Acceptance Criteria
Scenario: Delete program with confirmation
  Given a program "Test Program" exists
  When I click the delete icon for "Test Program"
  Then I see a confirmation dialog
  When I confirm deletion
  Then "Test Program" is removed from the program list
Scenario: Cancel program deletion
  Given I click the delete icon for a program
  When I see the confirmation dialog
  And I click Cancel
  Then the program still exists in the list
## Requirements for the test plan
- All test cases must be in Gherkin
- Cover every AC with at least one test case
- Add edge cases the ACs don't mention
  (boundary values, empty inputs, special characters, duplicates, max-length)
- Add negative test cases (what should NOT happen)
- Structure each test case as:
  - ID (TC-001, TC-002, etc.)
  - Title (expected behavior, not action)
  - Preconditions
  - Steps (numbered)
  - Expected result
  - Priority (High / Medium / Low)
- Group by: Positive flows, Negative flows, Edge cases
## Output
- Structured test plan in Markdown
- Use real field names and values, not placeholders
- At the end: list any ambiguities or gaps in the ACs
