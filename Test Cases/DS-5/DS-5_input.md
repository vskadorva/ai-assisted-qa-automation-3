# Prompt Template "Test Plan" from a Jira Ticket
## Role
You are a senior QA engineer reviewing the feature described below.
## Task
Create a detailed test plan for the Program list filtering and display feature.
## Acceptance Criteria
Scenario: Display program list with key details
  Given programs exist in the system
  When I navigate to the Programs page
  Then I see a list showing each program's name and description
Scenario: Empty state when no programs exist
  Given no programs exist
  When I navigate to the Programs page
  Then I see a message indicating no programs have been created
  And I see a prompt to create the first program
## Requirements for the test plan
- All test cases must be in Gherkin
- Cover every AC with at least one test case
- Add edge cases the ACs don't mention
  (boundary values, empty inputs, special characters, duplicates, max-length)
- Add negative test cases (what should NOT happen)
- Structure each test case as:
  - ID (TC-001, TC-002, etc.)
  - Title (expected behavior, not action)
  - Preconditions
  - Steps (numbered)
  - Expected result
  - Priority (High / Medium / Low)
- Group by: Positive flows, Negative flows, Edge cases
## Output
- Structured test plan in Markdown
- Use real field names and values, not placeholders
- At the end: list any ambiguities or gaps in the ACs
