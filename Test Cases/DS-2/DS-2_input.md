# Prompt Template "Test Plan" from a Jira Ticket
## Role
You are a senior QA engineer reviewing the feature described below.
## Task
Create a detailed test plan for the Edit existing program details feature.
## Acceptance Criteria
Scenario: Open program for editing
  Given I am on the Programs page
  And a program "Web Development 2026" exists
  When I click the edit icon on "Web Development 2026"
  Then I see the edit form pre-populated with the program's current data
Scenario: Successfully edit a program name
  Given I am editing "Web Development 2026"
  When I change the Name to "Web Development 2026 - Updated"
  And I click Save
  Then the modal closes
  And the program list immediately shows "Web Development 2026 - Updated"
Scenario: Edit preserves unchanged fields
  Given I am editing a program
  When I only change the Description
  And I click Save
  Then the Name and other fields remain unchanged
## Requirements for the test plan
- All test cases must be in Gherkin
- Cover every AC with at least one test case
- Add edge cases the ACs don't mention
  (boundary values, empty inputs, special characters, duplicates, max-length)
- Add negative test cases (what should NOT happen)
- Structure each test case as:
  - ID (TC-001, TC-002, etc.)
  - Title (expected behavior, not action)
  - Preconditions
  - Steps (numbered)
  - Expected result
  - Priority (High / Medium / Low)
- Group by: Positive flows, Negative flows, Edge cases
## Output
- Structured test plan in Markdown
- Use real field names and values, not placeholders
- At the end: list any ambiguities or gaps in the ACs
