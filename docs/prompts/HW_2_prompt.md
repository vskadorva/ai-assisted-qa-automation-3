# Prompt Template "Test Plan" from a Jira Ticket
## Role
You are a senior QA engineer reviewing the feature described below.
## Task
Create a detailed test plan for the [DS title] feature.
## Acceptance Criteria
[See below]
## Requirements for the test plan
- All test cases must be in Gherkin
- Cover every AC with at least one test case
- Add edge cases the ACs don't mention
  (boundary values, empty inputs, special characters, duplicates, max-length)
- Add negative test cases (what should NOT happen)
- Structure each test case as:
  - ID (TC-001, TC-002, etc.)
  - Title (expected behavior, not action)
  - Preconditions
  - Steps (numbered)
  - Expected result
  - Priority (High / Medium / Low)
- Group by: Positive flows, Negative flows, Edge cases
## Output
- Structured test plan in Markdown
- Use real field names and values, not placeholders
- At the end: list any ambiguities or gaps in the ACs

DS-1: Create new academic program
AC: 
Scenario: Navigate to program creation form
  Given I am logged in as admin
  When I navigate to the Programs page
  And I click "+ New Program"
  Then I see the program creation form with fields: Program Name, Description

Scenario: Successfully create a program
  Given I am on the program creation form
  When I fill in Program Name with "Web Development 2026"
  And I fill in Description with "Full-stack web development program"
  And I click Create
  Then the modal closes
  And the program list shows "Web Development 2026"

Scenario: Validation prevents empty program name
  Given I am on the program creation form
  When I leave the Program Name field empty
  Then the Create button is disabled

DS-2: Edit existing program details
AC: 
Scenario: Open program for editing
  Given I am on the Programs page
  And a program "Web Development 2026" exists
  When I click the edit icon on "Web Development 2026"
  Then I see the edit form pre-populated with the program's current data
Scenario: Successfully edit a program name
  Given I am editing "Web Development 2026"
  When I change the Name to "Web Development 2026 - Updated"
  And I click Save
  Then the modal closes
  And the program list immediately shows "Web Development 2026 - Updated"
Scenario: Edit preserves unchanged fields
  Given I am editing a program
  When I only change the Description
  And I click Save
  Then the Name and other fields remain unchanged

DS-3: Program name validation and duplicate prevention
AC:
Scenario: Reject program name with only whitespace
  Given I am on the program creation form
  When I enter "   " as the program name
  And I click Create
  Then the form is not submitted (name is trimmed, treated as empty)
Scenario: Accept program name with special characters
  Given I am on the program creation form
  When I enter "Informatique & IA - Niveau 2" as the program name
  And I fill other required fields
  And I click Create
  Then the program is created successfully
Scenario: Reject duplicate program name
  Given a program "Web Development 2026" already exists
  When I try to create a new program with the same name
  Then I see an error indicating the name already exists

DS-4: Delete program with confirmation
AC:
Scenario: Delete program with confirmation
  Given a program "Test Program" exists
  When I click the delete icon for "Test Program"
  Then I see a confirmation dialog
  When I confirm deletion
  Then "Test Program" is removed from the program list
Scenario: Cancel program deletion
  Given I click the delete icon for a program
  When I see the confirmation dialog
  And I click Cancel
  Then the program still exists in the list

DS-5: Program list filtering and display
AC:
Scenario: Display program list with key details
  Given programs exist in the system
  When I navigate to the Programs page
  Then I see a list showing each program's name and description
Scenario: Empty state when no programs exist
  Given no programs exist
  When I navigate to the Programs page
  Then I see a message indicating no programs have been created
  And I see a prompt to create the first program
