# Jira Bug Reporter

Turn a Playwright failure into a Jira Bug linked to the original ticket, with steps, expected and actual results, the failing spec path, and screenshot evidence.

## Steps

1. Call `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` once. Reuse the returned `cloudId` on every Atlassian call. Pass `cloudId` as a top-level argument, never inside `inputs`.

2. Collect the failure from the Playwright output:
   - assertion error and stack
   - test title
   - spec path (`tests/*.spec.ts`)
   - browser and base URL from the run (do not read secrets)

3. Find the original ticket key from the `test.describe` name, the test title, or `features/<KEY>.feature` (for example `DS-1`). Fetch it with `getJiraIssue` and use its acceptance criteria for the expected result.

4. Decide the root cause before filing:
   - **Product defect** — the app violated the ticket. File the Bug.
   - **Test, credentials, or environment** — the spec, missing `DIDAXIS_EMAIL` / `DIDAXIS_PASSWORD`, or the environment failed. Explain that and stop. Do not create a product Bug.
   - **Duplicate** — search first. If an open Bug already covers this failure, return that key and do not create another.

5. Create the Bug with `createJiraIssue`, then link it and attach screenshots.

6. Reply with the Bug key, URL, link to the original ticket, attached filenames, and a one-line root cause.

## Duplicate check

Search with `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` before creating:

```
project = <PROJECT> AND issuetype = Bug AND issue in linkedIssues(<ORIGINAL-KEY>) AND statusCategory != Done ORDER BY created DESC
```

Reuse an open Bug whose summary or description matches this failure.

## Create the Bug

`createJiraIssue`:

- `projectKey`: prefix of the original key (`DS-1` → `DS`)
- `issueType`: `Bug`
- `summary`: what failed, including the original key
- `description`: markdown template below
- `contentFormat`: `markdown`

The reporter is the authenticated Jira user. Never put passwords, tokens, or other `.env` values in the summary, description, or attachments.

## Actual result

## Failed test

- Path: `tests/<spec>.spec.ts`
- Test: <test title>
- Error: <assertion message>

## Environment

- URL: <base URL>
- Browser: <browser>
```

## Link to the original ticket

`discover` is not required for this operation name. Call `executeWrite`:

- `name`: `createJiraIssueLink`
- `cloudId`: the cached site id
- `inputs.linkType`: `Relates`
- `inputs.inwardIssue`: the new Bug key
- `inputs.outwardIssue`: the original ticket key

If `Relates` is rejected, call `executeRead` with `name` `listJiraIssueLinkTypes` and use that site's "relates to" type.

## Attach screenshots

`playwright.config.ts` saves a trace on first retry only. It does not save screenshots.

1. Use existing `test-results/**/*.png` from the failed run.
2. If none exist, re-run only the failed test:

```bash
npx playwright test <spec> -g "<exact test title>" --screenshot=only-on-failure
```

3. Attach each `test-failed-*.png`. Keep the spec path in the description as well.

Attach a file with `executeWrite`, `name` `uploadAttachmentToJiraIssue`:

1. Phase 1: `inputs` `{ "issueIdOrKey": "<BUG-KEY>", "filePath": "<absolute png path>" }`. Run the returned `uploadCommand` in the shell and keep the `fileId`.
2. Phase 2: `inputs` `{ "issueIdOrKey": "<BUG-KEY>", "fileId": "<fileId>" }`.

Do not change Playwright config or test code to capture the screenshot.
